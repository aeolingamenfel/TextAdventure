	You are standing in a massive open field of grass almost up to your knees. A light
	breeze blows the grass into moving waves stretching far into the distance. Far off, 
	at the edge of the field, stands a large forest.

	To the south, an old, stone church stands as the lone sign of civilization.
	Winding to the north, a cobblestone path leads into the forest.
